        <h1>1: Fuel Efficiency Comparison:</h1>
        <p>Select a few popular car models (both gasoline and hybrid/electric) and compare their fuel efficiency.
            Conduct research on factors affecting fuel efficiency such as engine type, vehicle weight, aerodynamics, and driving conditions.
            Analyze the data and present findings on which types of cars are more fuel-efficient and under what circumstances.</p>

        <h1>2: Safety Features in Modern Cars:</h1>
        <p>Research and compile information on advanced safety features found in modern cars (e.g., adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, automatic emergency braking).
            Create a comparative analysis of these features across different car brands/models.
            Discuss the effectiveness of these safety features in reducing accidents and improving road safety.

        <h1>3: Environmental Impact of Automobiles:</h1>
        <p>Investigate the environmental impact of automobiles throughout their lifecycle (from manufacturing to disposal).
            Compare traditional gasoline-powered cars with hybrid and electric vehicles.
            Use data on carbon emissions, energy consumption, and resource depletion to assess the environmental footprint of different types of cars.</p>
